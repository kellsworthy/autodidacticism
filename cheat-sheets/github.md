# Cheat Sheet: GitHub

## About GitHub

GitHub allows people to store code, manage changes, and share it with the world. My goal is to use it to store all coding and analytics related "stuff." Wish me luck!

## Terminology

**Repository:** A directory that stores all of the folders, files, and changes related to a project.  
**Project:** A board for organizing and prioritizing work. There can be multiple projects per repository.  

**Remote:** An online or cloud environment like GitHub.  
**Local:** An offline environment typically on my computer.  

**Branch:** A parralel version of a repository that allows me to make changes and updates without affecting the live ("main") version.  
**Fork:** A remote copy of another person's repository that allows me to make changes and updates without affecting the original version. It can be synced with the latest changes to the original repository.  
**Clone:** A local copy of a repository that allows me to edit files in my preferred IDE and track changes without having to be online.  

**Commit:** A revision record that allows me to see what was changed, who changed it, and when it was changed.  
**Fetch:** Adding changes from remote to local *without* committing them. This allows me to review the changes before integrating them with my local copy.  
**Merge:** Takes the changes from one branch or fork and applies them to another.

**Pull:** Fetching and merging changes from remote to local.  If someone has edited a file I'm working on, I would want to pull those changes to my copy.  
**Push:** Sending my committed changes from local to remote. This allows the changes to be accessible to others.
